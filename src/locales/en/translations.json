    "integralRevolutionText": "A deep and comprehensive transformation of all parts of society, including its values and structure. The new, self-managed society is based on autonomy and the abolition of all forms of domination: the state, capitalism, patriarchy, and all other forms that affect human relationships and with the natural environment. Conscious and strategic actions are needed to compost the obsolescent structures and recover those values and qualities that enable us to live a life in common. As the most promising entry point for the collective change we see a new economic system. This is giving people the opportunity to finally exit the vicious circle of capitalistic enslavement and its side effects, to find space for new ideas without boundaries and make possible the switch to a healthy life in balance with nature.",
    "disobedienceText": "Disobedience implies, to some extent, to disobey certain laws or demands from dominant structures. Sometimes this becomes a civil duty when the law is considered wrongful. To understand this we refer to the difference between legal and just. Certain rules and laws might be legal on paper but cannot be considered just, which is often the case under repressive, fascistic or totalitarian governments. This can also indirectly or directly apply to western states, for example, when a government uses common taxes to finance 'lawful' war of aggression against another country and its civil society.",
    "openCooperativismText": "We follow and support the basic guidelines of cooperatives as they are driven by their participants, and based on mutual aid, self-responsibility, equality, democracy, and solidarity.  Everybody can participate actively and equally in making decisions and setting policies. The accumulated capital, gained mainly through the value increase of our currency FairCoin, is reinvested in the development of the ecosystem and related projects. This way participants can have access to more self-empowering tools and a constantly growing network of goods and services within the Fair Economy.",
    "decentralizationText": "One of our aims is to have decentralized organizational models of decisions and roles. By decentralizing our technology we prevent a central point of failure, thus avoiding that any authority can shut us down. We want to make sure that all participants can communicate, share ideas, work on projects or transfer value without repression or censorship. Distribution of political and economic power, combined with radical transparency, prevents abuse of roles with unique rights or access and thus prevents fraud, corruption or takeovers.",
    "statelessDemocracyText": "Capitalist modernity depends on the nation-state system, which in turn depends on a patriarchal and hierarchical collective mindset, deeply forged over centuries of humans oppressing humans. For the first time in history a combination of political awareness, weakness of the capitalist economy, and p2p cryptographic technology allows us to present serious and realistic alternatives to the current governing models. A global cooperative financial system gives us free and fair markets, a huge step forward. If this is combined with an unbreakable set of ethical values based on freedom, and democratic decision-making protocols, it starts to become a visible reality. If you believe life outside the state is possible, join FairCoop today."

  "about": {
    "content": "### Mission \n Our mission is to create an innovative glocal economic system from the bottom up in favor of an alternative and post-capitalist model to pave the way for a collective change towards a life in common. Cooperation, ethics, solidarity and transparency are key factors for us to create a truly justice system for everyone. The development and use of powerful interconnected digital tools (global) and regional networks (local) are crucial for our success. We are using our time and energy constructively and in a collaborative way to create real alternatives by putting theories into action. \n ### Vision \n   We envision a global network of self-organized and self-empowered local communities and individuals, independent of abusive centralized forces and restrictions. \n Our global principles and framework  are defined collectively, on behalf of the 99% and at the same time, are realized at a local level according to their specific regional needs and circumstances. This way people take back control of their own lives by having the freedom to choose diverse alternative society models based on a decentralized organization structure. \n Our cooperative work is creating an independent ecosystem, which aims to reduce global economic and social inequality, leading to a new global wealth accessible to everybody in the form of commons. Like a domino effect, the game-changing framework of this economic system will open the door for a global shift, impacting all aspects of life such as education, healthcare, energy, housing, transport, and creating opportunities to rediscover healthy and non-exploitative relationships with our fellow human beeings and nature.\n ### Principles \n The actions of the FairCoop community are based on three major branches of already existing principles: **Integral Revolution**,  **P2P Collaboration**, **Hacker Ethics** \n #### 1) Integral Revolution \n Is a process of historic significance, for the construction of a new self-managed society, based on autonomy and the abolition of all forms of domination: the state, capitalism, and all other forms that affect relationships both between humans and with the natural environment. It commits itself to conscious action, personal and collective, for the improvement and recovery of the values and qualities that enable us to live a life in common. \n It is based on the construction of new structures and forms of organization in all areas of life to ensure equality in decision-making and equity in meeting our basic and vital needs. \n These include:\n *  Equitable human relations based on freedom and non-coercion\n* Self-organization and sovereign popular assemblies\n*  The commons, the public\n    - Recover common ownership for the benefit of all, with popular possession and control \n    - Build a cooperative system that is public and self-managed, based upon mutual aid \n    - Liberate access to information and knowledge \n * A new economy based on cooperation and proximity. \n * Cooperation with life and the biosphere. \n ###### [Find out more about the concepts of the integral revolution](http://integrarevolucio.net/en/integral-revolution/ideological-bases-of-the-call/)\n #### 2) P2P Collaboration\n * P2P collaboration means that everybody takes on certain roles and tasks within the community as a voluntary commitment for the common good.\n* A direct reciprocity via the commitments accepted should not be expected. However, as each of the participants will try to maintain mutuality and solidarity within the Commons, there will be opportunities to get something back from the whole.\n* All collaboration dynamics are non-hierarchical, thus everybody involved is considered to have an equal voice in the process.\n* There is way more to learn about the P2P principles and its various sub-areas.\n ###### [Further valuable information you will find here](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Core_Peer-2-Peer_Collaboration_Principles)\n#### 3) Hacker Ethics\n Hacking is more than the social picture of cybercriminals with black hoodies. The way we, and most free tech people understands the action of hacking refers to moral values, freedom and improvement for the good. The keys to hacker ethics are:\n* All information should be free\n* Access to computersâ€”and anything which might teach you something about the way the world worksâ€”should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!\n* Mistrust authorityâ€”promote decentralization\n* Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not criteria such as degrees, age, race, sex, or position\n* You can create art and beauty on a computer\n* Computers can change your life for the better\n* Don't litter other people's data.\n* Make public data available, protect private data.\n###### [More information about hacker ethics here](https://ccc.de/en/hackerethik)"

    "content": "> FairCoop sees the revolution of the global economic system as the most promising entry point to provoke and initiate a collective change in society. \n \n One of the priority objectives of FairCoop is to build a new global economic system based on cooperation, ethics, solidarity, and justice in our economic relations. To achieve this we defined the major causes of today's ailing economic system and its mechanisms, which are causing the global imbalance of power and how to turn it to our common and global favor. \n \n Our plan is to restore the greatest level of global economic justice that we can, by:\n * using our own digital currency FairCoin and developing its own economic system which is completely independent of the central banks and institutions.\n* using FairCoin for something that has usually played against the Global South: market forces (supplyâ€“demand), hack them and insert the cooperative virus.\n* using the cooperative virus to create trust and incentives for everybody to invest in a cooperative system rather than a volatile and speculative competitive system.\n* using the stable growth strategy to increase the value of the currency due to the limited supply of currency units (deflationary character) and the increased demand of the currency.\n* using the increased value of the currency to finance projects and tools development which are aligned with the goals of FairCoop and constantly extend the infrastructure of the system.\n* using those projects, tools and infrastructure to facilitate the common use of FairCoin for further products and services which are in line with the FairCoop Principles, and thus increase its usability.\n * using this constantly increasing utility of FairCoin to be globally more and more independent from fiat currencies and move towards a circular economy.\n* using the circular economy, strengthened by including more and more products and services worldwide, to cover our basic needs and naturally incorporate more users (individuals, groups, networks) to FairCoin.\n* using our collective and financial power derived from constantly growing participation and users to empower and set free more and more people from any kind of economic or political suppression.\n* using the widely dispersed but interconnected tools, human networks, services and features of this independent decentralized system as a base for the social change of the whole global society, known as the integral revolution."

    "content": "The FairCoop communities organize themselves through open cooperativism. Everybody is encouraged to participate with their individual skills and help the movement grow. \n \n As we are working globally to support decentralization and the local economy our approach is to follow a glocal (global and local level combined) organization model: \n \n ### Global Work Area (Open Coop Work) \n The Global Work Areas refer mainly to online work, aiming to structure, organize, and develop information and technology for the global network. All tasks are organized in our open collaborative platform (OCP). Participants can either volunteer their hours or claim a remuneration in FairCoin for the work needed to be done.\n \n The working areas are:\n * Common Management\n *  Communication\n  * Circular Economy\n  * Technology Development\n  * Welcome-Education-Support\n ###### [more about the global work structures here](https://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/free-mind-map-ffa5505555b54101960e3138e13b5e89) \n ### Local Work Area \n The Local Nodes work refers to both to online and offline activities of the corresponding local node to develop the physical network on the ground with its focus on individual regional work.\n Some Local work areas could be:\n  * Dynamization of circular economy (merchants support)\n  * Promotion of different FairCoop Tools\n * Managing a Point of Exchange (PoE)\n * Promote FairCoop values and practices to local projects\n * Construction of locally specific projects within the Faircoop ecosystem \n \n **Each Global Work Area and Local Node have internal decision autonomy through assemblies to fulfill their tasks and achieve their goals in its best way. Therefore, centralized permissions are not needed. However, key issues, which concern the whole community, are decided in the general global assembly, as always by consensus.**  \n\n **All global work areas and local nodes areas have diverse chat groups and subareas for daily communication and coordination.**\n \n If you are interested in participating, please join our [welcome group](https://t.me/askfaircoop) and get in direct contact with us. From there, we can lead you to the place which fits best to your interests and intentions.\n \n ###### [More details can be found in the Local Nodes guide here](https://git.fairkom.net/faircoop/MediaCommunication/wikis/How-to-create-a-Local-Node-%5Ben%5D). \n \n ### Local Nodes Network \n Local Nodes are the regional representation groups and expansion of FairCoop on the local level. They develop and broaden the regional network independently by promoting FairCoop tools to shops and individuals, giving technical support, holding presentations, answering all kinds of questions or even by starting their individual local nodes project within the framework of the FairCoop principles. Local Nodes can receive small fundings to cover basic costs with the intention of being self-sufficient over time. \n \n To establish a local node, at least 3 active participants are neccesary. We encourage everybody who is interested to get in direct contact with the people in the local node in your region. Further details you can here in [local nodes map](http://map.fairplayground.info/). If you cannot find a local node in your area  we are happy to help and support you in setting one up.\n \n ###### [More details can be found in the Local Nodes guide here](https://git.fairkom.net/faircoop/MediaCommunication/wikis/How-to-create-a-Local-Node-%5Ben%5D)"
